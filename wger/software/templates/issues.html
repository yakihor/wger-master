<p>{% blocktranslate %}
No software is perfect. For some severe errors, an email will be automatically sent, but
not always, so I depend on you reporting everything that didn't behave as expected.
Please describe in as much detail as you can what you were doing when the error
happened.

The issue tracker can also be used to document enhancements to the software.
If you have some suggestions or think a feature is missing, feel
free to open a ticket. This can be anything from a slight change to a whole
new section of the site. Please keep in mind that not all wishes can be
implemented.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
