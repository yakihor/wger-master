# Contributing to wger

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

Our goal is to build an awesome and flexible fitness and nutrition manager,
along with a comprehensive list of exercises and ingredients, all released
under a free license.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to wger
which is hosted in the wger-project Organization on GitHub.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. As everywhere in life, use your
best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document
in a pull request.

## Questions
Are you just using the software and have a question or improvement?

* Ask it on the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/wger-project/wger),
* the [discord server](https://discord.gg/rPWFv6W)
* or just [open an issue](https://github.com/wger-project/wger/issues)

## Issues
Describe the problem as well as you can. If useful, include any screenshots,
server logs or exceptions that you have access to and think might be relevant.
Include the git SHA1 if you have installed from source. If it's an enhancement,
describe a use-case or similar.

## Pull Requests
You want to contribute code? Awesome! Here are some tips:

* Make sure the tests are running (``python3 manage.py test``)...
* ... and if you write new code, write new tests
* Lint the code with flake8 (``flake8 --config .github/linters/.flake8 ./wger``)
and isort (``isort``) 
* You can expect a response from a maintainer within a week, if you
haven’t heard anything by then, feel free to ping the thread.


Thanks!
